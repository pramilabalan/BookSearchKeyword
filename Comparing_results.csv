2,Lives of Girls and Women,"<b>The only novel from bestselling author Alice Munro, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature</b>
<b>
</b>Catching frogs, grazing knees, singing songs to save England from Hitler - that was childhood for Del Jordan, and now she's impatient for more. 

More than she can find in the encyclopedias sold by her mother, or in the half-understood innuendos dispensed by best friend Naomi, or in the whispers of boys during Friday night dances. 
  
 Just like the girls in the movies, she wants to get started on real life.
  
 In her only novel, Alice Munro turns her eye to the frustrations, embarrassments, glee and bewilderment of adolescence, and to the brushes with sex, death, violence and birth that shape the lives of girls and women.

5,Chanel,"By the end of the First World War, Gabrielle 'Coco' Chanel had revolutionised women's dress. But dress was the most visible aspect of more profound changes she helped to bring about. During the course of her extraordinary and unconventional journey - from abject poverty to a new kind of glamour - Chanel would help forge the very idea of modern woman.

7,Building Jerusalem,"This is a history of the ideas that shaped not only London, but Manchester, Glasgow, Liverpool, Leeds, Birmingham, Sheffield and other power-houses of 19th-century Britain. It charts the controversies and visions that fostered Britain's greatest civic renaissance.

Tristram Hunt explores the horrors of the Victorian city, as seen by Dickens, Engels and Carlyle; the influence of the medieval Gothic ideal of faith, community and order espoused by Pugin and Ruskin; the pride in self-government, identified with the Saxons as opposed to the Normans; the identification with the city republics of the Italian renaissance - commerce, trade and patronage; the change from the civic to the municipal, and greater powers over health, education and housing; and finally at the end of the century, the retreat from the urban to the rural ideal, led by William Morris and the garden-city movement of Ebenezer Howard.",urban mythic,london history

8,Stravinsky (Volume 1),"In addition to being a great composer, Igor Stravinsky was one of the most fascinating personalities of his time. His life spanned an amazing range of events and places - pre-revolutionary Russia, Europe in the years between the wars, and the United States between 1941 and his death in 1971. 

Such masterworks as The Firebird, Petrushka, The Rite of Spring and many others fixed his reputation as a leading composer; his friendships - and often enmities - with most of his great intellectual contemporaries were famous. His personal life, which involved a double life between his official family and his mistress, was seldom placid. Touchy, unpredictable, witty and unfailingly brilliant, he is an ideal subject for a deeply informed and sophisticated biography. 

The first volume of this definitive biography covers Stravinsky's life and work from his birth in 1882 through to 1934, with special focus on his Russian roots and his struggles to make his way in Switzerland and France. It draws upon a great deal of new material, including unpublished archival sources, to illuminate the genius of both the music and Stravinsky the man.",stravinsky,stravinsky

16,On Power,"These are Shakespeare's greatest writings on power in all its forms - in love, in war, in politics and in the family. From Macbeth's vaulting ambition to Richard II's fragile grip on authority, from the violent rivalries of <I>King Lear</I> to the exquisite poetry of the love sonnets, these pieces show, with philosophical subtlety and psychological acuity, how we manipulate and dominate each other.

Throughout history, some books have changed the world. They have transformed the way we see ourselves - and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives - and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization and helped make us who we are.",play love,shakespeare complete work

21,A Season in Dornoch,"In 1977, Lorne Rubenstein, an avid golfer, travelled to Dornoch in the Scottish Highlands. Young and adrift in life, he was profoundly affected by the experience. As he writes, 'My week in Dornoch introduced me to a place with which I felt a connection. A week wasn't living there, but it was enough for Dornoch to imprint itself on my mind.'
 
 Twenty-three years later, in 2000, now an established golf writer, Rubenstein returned to Dornoch to spend an entire summer. He rented a flat close to the Royal Dornoch Golf Club and set out to explore the area on many levels.
 
 Rubenstein writes about the melancholy history of the Highland Clearances, which have left the beautiful landscape sparsely populated to this day. He writes about the friendly and sometimes eccentric people who love their town, their golf and their single malt whisky, and who delight in sharing them with visitors. But most of all he writes about a summer lived in a community where golf is king and the golf course is part of the common lands where townspeople stroll of an evening. Rubenstein is able to return to thinking of golf as play, as opposed to a game of analysis and effort.
 
 <i>A Season in Dornoch</i> is an affectionate portrait of a place and the people who live there, a fascinating look at golf and the spirit and skills it calls forth, and a perceptive and ultimately moving memoir of one man's quest to experience again the pure love of sport that he knew in his youth.",golf,jules verne book

 <i>A Season in Dornoch</i> is an affectionate portrait of a place and the people who live there, a fascinating look at golf and the spirit and skills it calls forth, and a perceptive and ultimately moving memoir of one man's quest to experience again the pure love of sport that he knew in his youth.",gyra golf,jules verne collection
21,A Season in Dornoch,"In 1977, Lorne Rubenstein, an avid golfer, travelled to Dornoch in the Scottish Highlands. Young and adrift in life, he was profoundly affected by the experience. As he writes, 'My week in Dornoch introduced me to a place with which I felt a connection. A week wasn't living there, but it was enough for Dornoch to imprint itself on my mind.'
 
 Twenty-three years later, in 2000, now an established golf writer, Rubenstein returned to Dornoch to spend an entire summer. He rented a flat close to the Royal Dornoch Golf Club and set out to explore the area on many levels.
 
 Rubenstein writes about the melancholy history of the Highland Clearances, which have left the beautiful landscape sparsely populated to this day. He writes about the friendly and sometimes eccentric people who love their town, their golf and their single malt whisky, and who delight in sharing them with visitors. But most of all he writes about a summer lived in a community where golf is king and the golf course is part of the common lands where townspeople stroll of an evening.

22,Leaving Dirty Jersey,"<i>Leaving Dirty Jersey</i> is the compellingly crafted tale of James Salant's descent into crystal meth addiction. Written at the age of only twenty-two, this memoir chronicles his year-long addiction with complete honesty and heartbreaking candour. 

Brought up in a stable, middle-class family, the second son of two therapists, he was introduced to heroin at seventeen by his brother Joe. This resulted in a spell in rehab where he met a bunch of ex-convicts, and he soon fell into the thuggish, drifting lifestyle of meth addiction. It was to take a near-psychotic event to finally get him to clean up.

With graphic descriptions of life on crystal meth - the insatiable sex drive, the paranoia, the desperate need for more drugs to sustain the high - James' writing mimics the emotional detachment of the drug and the wired yet aimless life it induces. His voice is so open and authentic, it is hard to believe he is still so young. 

Given the nickname Dirty Jersey, while living as a tough guy-junkie in California, James had it tattooed on the inside of his left arm. There it remains as a graphic and permanent reminder of his past life as a junkie.",addiction,dirty daddy anthology

In his ground-breaking book, Gary Younge argues that we have recoiled into refuges of race or class, religion or national identity to survive in a state seemingly indifferent to our lives. Ranging from his Stevenage childhood to present day America, from the borders of Europe to division in South Africa, Younge explores the issues that bind the powerful elite and the poor immigrant, the fundamentalist and the conservative.

This book is the unique product of a life spent farming the fields of rural Kentucky, and the rich, intimate knowledge of the place and its history cultivated by this work.

In a time when our relationship to the natural world is ruled by the reckless waste and greed of unbridled consumerism, Wendell Berry speaks out to defend the land we live on, imploring readers to return to the local landscapes that provide our cultural heritage, our history, our home.",olive farm,essay

35,The Messiah Myth,"Since the eighteenth century, scholars and historians studying the texts of the Bible have attempted to distil  historical facts and biography from the mythology and miracles described there. That trend continues into the present day, as scholars dissect the gospels and other early Christian writings to seperate the 'Jesus of history' from the 'Christ of faith'. But in <i>The Messiah Myth</i> Thomas L. Thompson argues that the quest for the historical Jesus is beside the point, since the Jesus of the gospels never existed.

Like King David before him, the Jesus of the Bible is an amalgamation of themes from Near Eastern mythology and traditions of kingship and divinity. The theme of a messiah - a divinely appointed king who restores the world to perfection - is typical of Egyptian and Babylonian royal ideology dating back to the Bronze Age. In Thompson's view, the contemporary audience for whom the Old and New Testament were written would naturally have interpreted David and Jesus not as historical figures , but as metaphors embodying long-established messianic traditions.

&lt;p&gt;The bicycle is one of mankind's greatest inventions - and the most popular form of transport in history. Robert Penn has ridden one most days of his adult life. In his late 20s, he pedalled 40,000 kilometres around the world. Yet, like cyclists everywhere, the utilitarian bikes he currently owns don't even hint at this devotion. Robert needs a new bike, a  bespoke machine that reflects how he feels when he's riding it - like an ordinary man touching the gods.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;<I>It's All About the Bike</I>&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a journey to design and build a dream bike. En route, Robert explores the culture, science and history of the bicycle. From Stoke-on-Trent, where an artisan hand builds his frame, to California, home of the mountain bike, where Robert tracks down the perfect wheels, via Portland, Milan and Coventry, birthplace of the modern bicycle, this is the narrative of our love affair with cycling. It's a tale of perfect components - parts that set the standard in reliability, craftsmanship and beauty. It tells how the bicycle has changed the course of human history, from the invention of the 'people's nag' to its role in the emancipation of women, and from the engineering marvel of the tangent-spoked wheel to the enduring allure of the Tour de France. It's the story of why we ride, and why this simple machine remains central to life today.",unleashed lt ryan,midlife cyclist

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;<I>It's All About the Bike</I>&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a journey to design and build a dream bike. En route, Robert explores the culture, science and history of the bicycle. From Stoke-on-Trent, where an artisan hand builds his frame, to California, home of the mountain bike, where Robert tracks down the perfect wheels, via Portland, Milan and Coventry, birthplace of the modern bicycle, this is the narrative of our love affair with cycling. It's a tale of perfect components - parts that set the standard in reliability, craftsmanship and beauty. It tells how the bicycle has changed the course of human history, from the invention of the 'people's nag' to its role in the emancipation of women, and from the engineering marvel of the tangent-spoked wheel to the enduring allure of the Tour de France. It's the story of why we ride, and why this simple machine remains central to life today.",bike maintenance,uncommon rider

44,Shine/Variance,"<b>""</b><b>Great, beautiful little studies</b> <b>of unspoken fear and longing and love, told with a sure-footed delicacy rare in a debut"" Sarah Moss, <i>Irish Times</i></b>
<b>
</b><b>""</b><b>An exciting, original, and very welcome new voice"" Donal Ryan</b>
<b>
</b><b>""These are startling, adventurous and often wonderful stories. I loved this collection"" Roddy Doyle</b><b>

</b><b>A sharp and insightful debut short story collection about the pitfalls of ordinary life </b>

A wife yearns to escape the tight-fisted confines of a package holiday. A boy dreams of footballing greatness as his mother mourns a loss. A man tries to assemble an absent child's playhouse, with impossible instructions and too much beer. A woman seeks clarity from automated voices. A father is distracted from Christmas tree shopping with his son by the looming pressure of quarterly sales targets.
 
<i>Shine/Variance</i> captures the tiny crises and wonders of daily life with warmth, wit and decisive clarity. Ordinary people - commuters, call centre workers, children and parents - struggle for stability while craving more, and the schism between expectation and reality is only rarely bridged. Yet, amidst the faltering, recognition and bright moments of hope still illuminate their days.
 
Fresh, tender and darkly funny, these stories are a window into the longings, frustrations and painfully human connections of ordinary life from a remarkable new voice in fiction.

<b>""</b><b>The most powerful new collection I've read in some years"" John Boyne</b>

In September 1944, a mighty shock force of battle-hardened Allied troops dropped from the skies into enemy-occupied Holland in what was hoped would be the decisive final battle of World War II. Landing miles behind the German lines, their daring mission was to secure bridges across the Rhine so that ground forces could make a rapid dash into Nazi Germany. If all went well, the war could be over by Christmas. The plan went terribly wrong ...

Seen through the dramatic first-hand accounts of those who were there, this is the gripping story of a bitter military defeat that became a triumph of the human spirit.

47,An Obsession With Butterflies,"From Hindu mythology to Aztec sacrifices, butterflies have served as a metaphor for resurrection and transformation. Even during World War II, children in a Polish death camp scratched hundreds of butterflies onto the wall of their barracks. But as Sharman Apt Russell points out in this rich and lyrical meditation, butterflies have above all been objects of obsession. 

From the beastly horned caterpillar whose blood helps it count time, to the peacock butterfly with wings that hiss like a snake, Russell traces butterflies through their life cycles, exploring the creatures' own obsessions with eating, mating, and migrating. She reveals the logic behind our endless fascination with butterflies as well as the driving passion of such legendary collectors as the tragic Eleanor Glanville, whose children declared her mad because of her compulsive butterfly collecting, and the brilliant Henry Walter Bates, whose collections from the Amazon in 1858 helped develop his theory of mimicry in nature. 

Russell also takes us inside some of the world's most prestigious natural history museums, where scientists painstakingly catalogue and categorize new species of Lepidoptera, hoping to shed light on insect genetics and evolutionAn Obsession with Butterflies is a luminous journey through an exotic world of strange beauty; a book to be treasured by anyone who's ever watched a butterfly mid-flight.",butterfly,mythology

Here, we learn how her family played a crucial role in helping to shape her dreams and aspirations from an early age. We hear of the difficult times growing up and how Chantelle was able to overcome these obstacles, eventually launching a career in modeling.

Winning Big Brother was a defining moment, and the madness that followed in those first few days outside of the house was to be just the beginning of Chantelle's new dream life. Learning to become accustomed to her new found fame hasn't been straightforward, but Chantelle has always kept her feet firmly on the ground.

54,Travels with Charley,"'Delightful. This is a book to be read slowly for its savor.'  <i>The Atlantic</i>
<i>
</i><b>In 1960, John Steinbeck set out in his pick-up truck with his dog Charley to rediscover and chronicle his native USA, from Maine to California.</b>
 
He felt that he might have lost touch with its sights, sounds and the essence of the American people. Moving through the woods and deserts, dirt tracks and highways to large cities and glorious wildernesses, Steinbeck observed - with remarkable honesty, insight and a humorous eye - the gamut of America and the people who inhabited it. 
 
His 10,000-mile journey took him through almost forty states, where he saw things that made him proud, angry, sympathetic and elated. A rugged and passionate adventure of self-identity, Steinbeck's vision of the changing world still speaks to us prophetically through the decades.

66,Dark Lady,"Jennie Jerome was a controversial American society girl and mother of Britain's most revered statesman, Winston Churchill. A single-minded and dynamic woman she was an early feminist, advocate of Irish independence, and, above all, was notorious for her promiscuity. 

Charles Higham draws from previously overlooked sources to provide much that is startlingly new about the remarkable and tempestuous life of Jennie Jerome. The book charts her luxurious New York upbringing, her eyebrow-raising entry into the British aristocracy through marriage to Lord Randolph Churchill, son of the Duke of Marlborough, her endless line of liaisons with men of vastly inferior years, and a very different sort of affair in the highest of high places - with the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII (one of many kings and princes to win her affection).

81,In a Flight of Starlings,"The world is shaped by complexity. In this enlightening book, Nobel Prize winner Giorgio Parisi guides us through his unorthodox yet exhilarating work to show us how. It all starts with investigating the principles of physics by observing the sophisticated flight patterns of starlings. Studying the movements of these birds, he has realized, proves an illuminating way into understanding complex systems of all kinds - collections of everything from atoms to planets to other animals like ourselves.

Along the way, Parisi reflects on the lessons he's taken from a life in pursuit of scientific truth: the importance of serendipity to the discovery of new ideas, the surprising kinship between physics and other fields of study and the value of science to a thriving society. In so doing, he removes the practice of science from the confines of the laboratory and brings it into the real world. Complexity is all around us - from climate to finance to biology, it offers a unique way of finding order in chaos.

82,How to Be a Beta Male,"<b>From rom coms to wrestling and fatherhood to fist fights, Robert Crampton's <i>How to Be a Beta Male</i> is a brilliantly funny and sometimes moving insight into being a modern-day bloke.</b>

Robert Crampton has been writing his Beta Male column for <i>The</i> <i>Times</i> since 2001. A much-loved weekly insight into modern masculinity – whatever that might mean – Beta Male strives to unlock the secrets of contemporary relationships in all their frequent glory, occasional frustration and on-going complexity. While by his own admission totally failing in this task, Crampton is at any rate amusing as he goes about his business, as his legions of loyal fans would attest.
 
<i>How to be a Beta Male</i> is a carefully curated selection, bursting with observational nuggets on the minutiae of daily domestics and disasters in the Crampton household, and offering the very best of a sixteen-year-long account of what it is to be a beta male married to an alpha female. From his attempts at DIY to disciplining their children to trying once in a while to put his foot down to getting involved in a punch-up in the street in her defence, Robert continues to fail to impress his wife but always delights his readers.

It's a very smart, extremely funny and yet  surprisingly sensitive  exploration of the trials, tribulations – and,  ultimately, triumphs –  of not being young, free and single.",beta,sci fi romance

<i>How to be a Beta Male</i> is a carefully curated selection, bursting with observational nuggets on the minutiae of daily domestics and disasters in the Crampton household, and offering the very best of a sixteen-year-long account of what it is to be a beta male married to an alpha female. From his attempts at DIY to disciplining their children to trying once in a while to put his foot down to getting involved in a punch-up in the street in her defence, Robert continues to fail to impress his wife but always delights his readers.

It's a very smart, extremely funny and yet  surprisingly sensitive  exploration of the trials, tribulations – and,  ultimately, triumphs –  of not being young, free and single.",rational male,scifi romance

98,Freedom Next Time,"John Pilger is one of the world's pre-eminent investigative journalists and documentary film-makers. His best-selling books of reportage, which include <i>Heroes </i>and <i>Hidden Voices</i>, have in the words of Noam Chomsky 'been a beacon of light in often dark times'. 

In <i>Freedom Next Time</i> he looks at five countries, in each of which a long struggle for freedom has taken place; in each the people, having shed blood and dreams, are still waiting. In Afghanistan, Iraq and South Africa there has been the promise of hope, and even an 'official' freedom, but the reality of these divided societies is that they are still waiting for real freedom. In Palestine, the cycle of violence continues with no resolution in sight. And the island of Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean, is a microcosm of the ruthlessness of great powers. The island was sold by the British to the American military in the 1960s. The indigenous population, descended from slaves, were forcibly removed to the slums of Port Louis in Mauritius. They have continued to fight for the return of their homeland ever since - three years ago the High Court granted them the right of return, but this has subsequently been blocked. The island remains the US's third biggest military base; a base from which they are able to launch attacks against the Middle East.

105,The Wonderful World of Albert Kahn,"In 1909 the millionaire French banker and philanthropist Albert Kahn embarked on an ambitious project to create a colour photographic record of, and for, the peoples of the world. As an idealist and an internationalist, Kahn believed that he could use the new Autochrome process, the world's first user-friendly, true-colour photographic system, to promote cross-cultural peace and understanding.

Until recently, Kahn's huge collection of 72,000 Autochromes remained relatively unheard of. Now, a century after he launched his project, this photography book and the BBC TV series it accompanies are bringing these dazzling historical photos to a mass audience for the first time and putting colour into what we tend to think of as an entirely monochrome age.

Kahn sent photographers to more than 50 countries, often at crucial junctures in their history, when age-old cultures were on the brink of being changed for ever by war and the march of 20th-century globalisation. They documented in true colour the collapse of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires, the last traditional Celtic villages in Ireland, and the soldiers of the First World War. They took the earliest known colour photographs in countries as far apart as Vietnam and Brazil, Mongolia and Norway, Benin and the United States. In 1929 the Wall Street Crash forced Kahn to bring his project to an end. He died in 1940, but left behind the most important collection of early colour photographs in the world.",colour,history dk

113,Two Can Keep a Secret,"Ellery's never been to Echo Ridge, but she's heard all about it. It's where her aunt went missing at age sixteen, never to return. Where a Homecoming Queen's murder five years ago made national news. And where Ellery now has to live with a grandmother she barely knows, after her failed-actress mother lands in rehab. No one knows what happened to either girl, and Ellery's family is still haunted by their loss.
Malcolm grew up in the shadow of the Homecoming Queen's death. His older brother was the prime suspect and left Echo Ridge in disgrace. His mother's remarriage vaulted her and Malcolm into Echo Ridge's upper crust, but their new status grows shaky when mysterious threats around town hint that a killer plans to strike again. No one has forgotten Malcolm's brother-and nobody trusts him when he suddenly returns to town.


Ellery and Malcolm both know it's hard to let go when you don't have closure. Then another girl disappears, and Ellery and Malcolm were the last people to see her alive. As they race to unravel what happened, they realize every secret has layers in Echo Ridge. The truth might be closer to home than either of them want to believe.

116,Lessons in Stoicism,"<i>What aspects of your life do you really control? What do you do when you cannot guarantee that things will turn out in your favour? And what can Stoicism teach us about how to live together?</i>

In the past few years, Stoicism has been making a comeback. But what exactly did the Stoics believe? In <i>Lessons in Stoicism</i>, philosopher John Sellars weaves together the key ideas of the three great Roman Stoics - Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius - with snapshots of their fascinating lives, to show us how their ideas can help us today.  

In vivid prose, Sellars shows how the works of these three Stoics have inspired readers ever since, speaking as they do to some of the perennial issues that face anyone trying to navigate their way through life. Their works, fundamentally, are about how to live - how to understand one's place in the world, how to cope when things don't go well, how to manage one's emotions and how to behave towards others.

121,The Bridge on the Drina,"The town of Visegrad was long caught between the warring Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires, but its sixteenth-century bridge survived unscathed--until 1914 when tensions in the Balkans triggered the first World War. Spanning generations, nationalities, and creeds, <i>The Bridge on the Drina</i> brilliantly illuminates a succession of lives that swirl around the majestic stone arches. Among them is that of the bridge's builder, a Serb kidnapped as a boy by the Ottomans; years later, as the empire's Grand Vezir, he decides to construct a bridge at the spot where he was parted from his mother. A workman named Radisav tries to hinder the construction, with horrific consequences. Later, the beautiful young Fata climbs the bridge's parapet to escape an arranged marriage, and, later still, an inveterate gambler named Milan risks everything on it in one final game with the devil. With humor and compassion, Ivo Andric chronicles the ordinary Catholics, Muslims, and Orthodox Christians whose lives are connected by the bridge, in a land that has itself been a bridge between East and West for centuries.",miranda bridge,bridge love

127,SAS,"In the summer of 1941, at the height of the war in the Western Desert, a bored and eccentric young officer, David Stirling, came up with a plan that was radical and entirely against the rules: a small undercover unit that would inflict mayhem behind enemy lines. So began the most celebrated and mysterious military organisation in the world: the SAS.

Now, the SAS has finally decided to tell its astonishing story. It has opened its secret archives for the first time, granting historian Ben Macintyre full access to a treasure trove of unseen reports, memos, diaries, letters, maps and photographs, as well as free rein to interview surviving Originals and those who knew them.

The result is an exhilarating tale of fearlessness and heroism, recklessness and tragedy; of extraordinary men who were willing to take monumental risks. It is a story about the meaning of courage.",sas military book,war fiction

Now, the SAS has finally decided to tell its astonishing story. It has opened its secret archives for the first time, granting historian Ben Macintyre full access to a treasure trove of unseen reports, memos, diaries, letters, maps and photographs, as well as free rein to interview surviving Originals and those who knew them.

The result is an exhilarating tale of fearlessness and heroism, recklessness and tragedy; of extraordinary men who were willing to take monumental risks. It is a story about the meaning of courage.",swagger sas,war fiction book

<b>
13th July 2014, World Cup Final, the last ten minutes of extra time. </b>Germany forward Mario Götze, receiving a floated pass from his international teammate André Schürrle, jumps slightly to meet the ball and cushion it with his chest. Landing on his left foot, he takes a step with his right, swivels, and in one fluid motion, without the ball touching the ground, volleys it past the onrushing Argentine goalkeeper into the far corner of the net. The goal wins Germany the World Cup for the first time in almost twenty-five years.

The answer takes him from California to Stuttgart, from Munich to the Maracaná, via Dortmund and Durban.

There she finds shelter with its only other inhabitants: a man named Cruso and his tongueless slave Friday. In time, she builds a life for herself as Cruso's companion and, eventually, his lover. At last, they are rescued by a passing ship, but only she and Friday survive the journey back to London.

Determined to have her story told, she pursues the eminent man of letters Daniel Foe in the hope that he will truthfully relate her memories to the world. But with Cruso dead, Friday incapable of speech and Foe himself intent on reshaping her narrative, Barton struggles to maintain her grip on the past, only to fall victim to the seduction and tyranny of storytelling itself.

But with Cruso dead, Friday incapable of speech and Foe himself intent on reshaping her narrative, Barton struggles to maintain her grip on the past, only to fall victim to the seduction and tyranny of storytelling itself.

Treacherous, elegant and unexpectedly moving, <I>Foe </I>remains one of the most exquisitely composed of this pre-eminent author's works.",friday,woman prize fiction
136,Do They Hear You When You Cry,"Like the bestsellers Princess and Not Without My Daughter, Do They Hear You When You Cry? tells the dramatic, compulsively readable story of a woman fighting to free herself from the injustices of her culture.  Fauziya Kassindja's harrowing story begins in Togo, Africa, where she enjoyed a sheltered childhood, shielded by her progressive father from the tribal practice of polygamy and genital mutilation.  But when her father died in 1993, Fauziya's life changed dramatically.  At the age of seventeen, she was forced to marry a man she barely knew who already had three wives, and prepare for the tribal ritual practice of genital mutilation - a practice that is performed without painkillers or antibiotics.  But hours before the ritual was to take place, Fauziya's sister helped her escape to Germany, and from there she travelled to the United States seeking asylum - and freedom.  Instead she was stripped, shackled and imprisoned for sixteen months by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Enter Layli Miller Bashir, a twenty-three-year-old law student who took on Fauziya's case.  When the two women met, Layli found a broken, emaciated girl with whom she forged an extraordinary friendship.  Putting her heart into Fauziya's case, Layli enlisted help from the American University International Human Rights Clinic.  The clinic's acting director Karen Musalo, an expert in refugee law, assembled a team to fight on Fauziya's behalf.  Ultimately, in a landmark decision that has given hope to many seeking asylum on the grounds of gender-based persecution, Fauziya was granted asylum on 13 June 1996.
Here, for the first time, is Fauziya's dramatic personal story, told in her own words, vividly detailing her life as a young woman in Togo and her nightmarish day-to-day existence in American prisons.  It is a story of faith and freedom, courage and inspiration - one that you will not easily forget.",asylum,little princess book

146,A Woman In Charge,"<i>A Woman in Charge</i> reveals the true trajectory of Hillary's astonishing life and career. From a staunchly Republican household and apparently idyllic Midwestern girlhood - her disciplinarian father here revealed as harsher than she has acknowledged - we see the shaping of a brilliant girl whose curiosity was fuelled by the ferment of the 1960s and a desire to change the world. During her student years, she was already perceived as a spokeswoman for her generation. Then, at Yale Law School, she met and fell in love with Bill Clinton, cancelling her own dreams to tie her fortunes to his.

Bernstein clarifies the often amazing dynamic of their marriage, charting both her political acumen and her blind spots, and untangling her relationship to the great controversies of Whitewater, Troopergate and Travelgate. And then, in the emotional and political chaos of the Lewinsky affair we see Hillary standing by her husband - evoking a rising wave of sympathy from a public previously cool to her and in effect, Bernstein argues, saving his presidency. It helps carry her into the Senate: her time has come. As she decides to run for President, this self-described 'mind-conservative and heart liberal' has one more chance to fulfill her long-deferred ambitions.

Bernstein has interviewed some 200 of her colleagues, friends and enemies and was given unique access to the candid record of the 1992 presidential campaign kept by Hillary's best friend, Diane Blair. Marshalling all the skills and energy that propelled his history-making Pulitzer prize-winning coverage of Watergate, he gives us a detailed, sophisticated, comprehensive and revealing account of the complex human being and political meteor who has already helped define one presidency and may well become the woman in charge of another.",hillary mantell,hilary clinton

150,Consciousness And The Novel,"Human consciousness, long the province of literature, has lately come in for a remapping - even rediscovery - by the natural sciences, driven by developments in Artificial Intelligence, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology. But as the richest record we have of human consciousness, literature, David Lodge suggests, may offer a kind of knowledge about this phenomenon that is complementary, not opposed, to scientific knowledge. Writing with characteristic wit and brio, and employing the insight and acumen of a skilled novelist and critic, Lodge here explores the representation of human consciousness in fiction (mainly English and American) in the light of recent investigations in cognitive science, neuroscience, and related disciplines. How, Lodge asks, does the novel represent consciousness? And how has this changed over time? In a series of interconnected essays, he pursues this question down various paths: how does the novel's method compare with that of other creative media such as film? How does the consciousness (and unconscious) of the creative writer do its work? And how can criticism infer the nature of this process through formal analysis? In essays on Charles Dickens, E.M. Forster, Evelyn Waugh, Kingsley and Martin Amis, Henry James, John Updike and Philip Roth, and in reflections on his own practice as a novelist, Lodge brings to light - and to engaging life",consciousness,literature

Steeped in myth, fairy tale and biblical allusion, the novel depicts Mallorca as an enchanted but wicked island, a lost Eden and Never Never Land combined, where the sun burns through stained glass windows and the wind tears itself on the agaves. Ostensibly concerned with Matia's anxieties about entering the adult world, this internal conflict is set against the much wider, deeper, and more frightening conflict of the civil war as it plays out almost secretly on the island, set in turn against the backdrop of the Inquisition's mass burning of Jews in previous centuries.

155,Revolusi,"<b>A story of staggering scope and drama, <i>Revolusi</i> is the masterful and definitive account of the epic revolution that sparked the decolonisation of the modern world.</b>

On a sunny Friday morning in August 1945, a handful of tired people raised a homemade cotton flag and on behalf of 68 million compatriots announced the birth of a new nation. With the fourth largest population in the world, inhabiting islands that span an eighth of the globe, Indonesia became the first colonised country to declare its independence after the Second World War.

Four million civilians had died during the wartime occupation by the Japanese that ousted the Dutch colonial regime.

He wrote at least 220 news commentaries for, and broadcast to, India and occupied Malaya and Indonesia, of which Orwell read fifty-six..

Fifty years later, Annie is looking for her long-lost grandmother. Armed with nothing more than a sheaf of papers, she travels from England to Paris in pursuit of the truth. But as she traces her grandmother’s story, Annie uncovers something she wasn’t expecting, something that changes everything she knew about her family – and everything she thought she knew about herself…

162,This is Where We Live,"Life is beautiful for Claudia and Jeremy. They are a young, bohemian couple whose hard work in both the film and music world is finally paying off. Claudia's first film is in the can and Jeremy and his band are going places. Now seems like the perfect time to settle down and buy a house.

But this is summer 2008, and the credit crunch is round the corner.

The life they've been dreaming of comes tumbling down around them. Claudia takes a teaching job in attempt to placate the bank, and suddenly everything their relationship has been built on looks precarious. Jeremy sees her 'selling out' as a betrayal of their bohemian values, and when his glamorous ex-girlfriend Aoki, a famous painter, returns to LA, Claudia starts to realise that her relationship is in danger of disintegrating unless she does something to save it...",claudia roden med,perfect addiction claudia

170,Mosquito,"Built of lightweight wood, powered by two growling Rolls Royce engines, impossibly aerodynamic, headspinningly fast, armed to the teeth, the DeHavilland Mosquito was the plane which never should have existed. Designed, built, tested and flying operations within 13 months of its original conception, it was the answer to the RAF's prayers in the Second World War: an utterly versatile plane which would leave the Luftwaffe in its wake, could fly in under the radar and delivers 2000 lbs of bombs when and where the enemy was least expecting it.

It was corralled into a critical pathfinding role for the hundreds of heavy bomber raids as the tide of the war turned but its reputation was cemented by a series of daredevils raids across Europe, including on Berlin itself, where stealth, speed and precision were required.

So when the Special Operations Executive needed a plane to drop a bomb on the Gestapo HQ right in the centre of Copenhagen to prevent the plans for D-Day being tortured out of Danish resistance fighters, there was only one plane for the job - the Mosquito. This is the story of this brilliant aircraft told through that one impossible mission.

Like Rowland White's previous books, <i>Mosquito</i> is an unputdownable mix of utterly compelling storytelling, incredible human stories and fascinating technological detail, which sheds never-before-told light on a pivotal mission that helped bring the war to its bloody and brutal close.",plane,aircraft book

It was corralled into a critical pathfinding role for the hundreds of heavy bomber raids as the tide of the war turned but its reputation was cemented by a series of daredevils raids across Europe, including on Berlin itself, where stealth, speed and precision were required.

So when the Special Operations Executive needed a plane to drop a bomb on the Gestapo HQ right in the centre of Copenhagen to prevent the plans for D-Day being tortured out of Danish resistance fighters, there was only one plane for the job - the Mosquito. This is the story of this brilliant aircraft told through that one impossible mission.

Like Rowland White's previous books, <i>Mosquito</i> is an unputdownable mix of utterly compelling storytelling, incredible human stories and fascinating technological detail, which sheds never-before-told light on a pivotal mission that helped bring the war to its bloody and brutal close.",plane,aircraft

171,Inheritance,"<b>Master storyteller and internationally bestselling author Christopher Paolini returns to the World of Eragon with Murtagh. Murtagh, a stunning epic fantasy set a year after the events of the Inheritance Cycle, will publish in 2023.</b>


<b>It began with Eragon . . . It ends with Inheritance, book four in The Inheritance Cycle. </b>

Not so very long ago, Eragon - Shadeslayer, Dragon Rider - was nothing more than a poor farm boy, and his dragon, Saphira, only a blue stone in the forest. Now, the fate of an entire civilization rests on their shoulders.

When they do, they will have to be strong enough to defeat him. And if they can't, no one can. There will be no second chances.

The Rider and his dragon have come farther than anyone dared to hope. But can they topple the evil king and restore justice to Alagaësia? And if so, at what cost?

176,All Bones And Lies,"Colin is in many ways an ideal citizen. He holds down a responsible job for the council. He visits his aged mother Nora, shops for her, cooks for her, and listens to her grumbles. He also keeps in touch with his sister Dilys, long estranged from her mother, in a vain attempt to maintain family ties. But neither Dilys, Norah nor Colin's colleagues know about his other - much more secret - life that involves a garden shed, a circus acrobat, a much adored three-year-old charmer, and a certain Mr Haksar's increasingly disquieting penchant for squabbling with his neighbours.

What Colin doesn't know is that, thanks to a house insurance policy incorrectly filled in by his mother, his two lives are set to collide, and there is nothing he can do to stop them. With her customary wit and perception, subtle yet razor sharp in her powers of observation, Anne Fine has produced another tour de force. Her portrait of the complex dynamics of family relationships is as lucid as it is uncomfortable, ending with a climax that in its wry irony and sheer unexpectedness is truly shocking.",colin flaherty,colin

187,Gardening for Bumblebees,"<b>'Go on, have a flutter! Take a few tips from the new book by biologist Dave Goulson and it's a safe bet that beautiful butterflies will start gathering in your garden' </b>
<b><i>Daily Mail</i></b>


<b>From the <i>Sunday Times</i> bestselling author of <i>A Sting In The Tale </i>comes this practical guide to creating a paradise for pollinators.</b>

There are twenty six different species of bumblebees to be found in the UK, of around 250 species worldwide. Bumblebees are among the most important of our insects; these superb pollinators ensure that wildflowers set seed and reappear each year, and that our vegetable and fruit crops give us bountiful harvests. With the decline in the populations of our wild bees, these beloved creatures need looking after more than ever.

<i>Gardening for Bumblebees </i>shows you how you can provide a refuge for bumblebees to feed, breed and thrive. No matter how large or small your space is, Dave Goulson shows you how you can make a pollinator-friendly haven. In this book you will learn the best trees, shrubs and flowers for pollinators, how to create the perfect nest and breeding site, and the best ways to control pests. <i>Gardening For Bumblebees </i>will encourage and inspire gardeners and allotmenters alike to make their patch more bee friendly.

<b><u>Praise for Dave Goulson</u></b>

'Ideal for filling the garden with a happy hum'
<b>Tiffany Daneff, <i>Country Life</i></b>

'Goulson reminds himself that he 'began studying bumblebees not because they are important pollinators but because they are fascinating, because they behave in interesting and mysterious ways, and because they are rather loveable'

There are twenty six different species of bumblebees to be found in the UK, of around 250 species worldwide. Bumblebees are among the most important of our insects; these superb pollinators ensure that wildflowers set seed and reappear each year, and that our vegetable and fruit crops give us bountiful harvests. With the decline in the populations of our wild bees, these beloved creatures need looking after more than ever.

<i>Gardening for Bumblebees </i>shows you how you can provide a refuge for bumblebees to feed, breed and thrive. No matter how large or small your space is, Dave Goulson shows you how you can make a pollinator-friendly haven. In this book you will learn the best trees, shrubs and flowers for pollinators, how to create the perfect nest and breeding site, and the best ways to control pests. <i>Gardening For Bumblebees </i>will encourage and inspire gardeners and allotmenters alike to make their patch more bee friendly.

202,Forgotten Voices of the Falklands,"The Falklands War was a turning point in modern British history. On the one hand, it was what some considered to be the 'last of the great Elizabethan adventures', with the Royal Navy pulling off an incredible feat of maritime warfare, under the most appallingly risky circumstances. On the other hand, it was the first war of the modern age, using satellite surveillance, computer-driven missiles, night observation devices, and all the technologically developed power of modern weaponry. It was also a conflict that could so easily have gone terribly wrong for British forces. Instead, it was a resounding military success.

And yet, the conflict's significance is often overlooked. Drawing upon the vast resources of the Imperial War Museum's sound archive, which contains thousands of interviews with both soldiers and civilians, both British and Argentinean, <i>Forgotten Voices of the Falkands War</i> redresses the balance, presenting a complete oral history of the Falklands War. From the initial invasion of the islands to the British landings, the sinking of the Belgrano to brutal combat at Goose Green, the Argentinean surrender through to its aftermath, the book is a unique and essential chronicle of the conflict told from all sides and perspectives. It includes the visceral and often terrifying experiences of the combatants as well as the poignant and sometimes surreal recollections of the islanders caught in the middle.

Utilising all the qualities that have made the <i>Forgotten Voices</i> series so popular, Hugh McManners, who himself fought in the Falklands War and witnessed its brutality first-hand, has created the definitive oral history on the subject.",falklands war book,falklands war book

It ends with the Tories again in power, but on the eve of Margaret Thatcher's fall, while Tony Benn is on a mission to Baghdad before the impending Gulf War.

The narrative starts with Benn as a schoolboy and takes the reader through his youthful wartime experiences as a trainee pilot, his nervous excitement as a new MP during Clement Atlee's premiership and the tribulations of Labour in the 1950s, when the Conservatives were in firm control. It ends with the Tories again in power, but on the eve of Margaret Thatcher's fall, while Tony Benn is on a mission to Baghdad before the impending Gulf War.

Over the span of fifty years, the public and private turmoil in British and world politics is recorded as Benn himself moves from wartime service to become the baby of the House, Cabinet Minister, and finally the Commons' most senior Labour Member.",mitch benn terra,teneues diary 2022

217,The Intimate Animal,"<b>An evolutionary exploration of love, sex and relationships.</b>

Dr. Justin Garcia is a world-leading expert on the science of love and sex. In his first book, he explores the multiplicity of human sexual and romantic behaviour, the forces behind our intimacy instincts, and why humans across the globe live and die for love.

Our competing evolutionary desires for sex and intimacy create highs and lows in our romantic and sexual lives. <i>The Intimate Animal</i> provides practical tips on love and attraction - two biological systems often in painful conflict - and presents compelling case studies to help deepen and strengthen our relationships. Sharing the knowledge that he has acquired working on the frontlines of modern love and sex research, Dr. Garcia helps us to understand the science behind a spectrum of human intimate experiences. From the intimacy crisis, physical affection, redefining gender roles and courtship norms, to understanding why we stay in abusive relationships and stray from fulfilling ones, this book will help you understand how to successfully look for love and cultivate a rewarding relationship in an ever-changing, high-speed digital age.

From infatuation to heartbreak, <i>The Intimate Animal</i> offers us the first evolutionary understanding of the entire life course of our intimate relationships - how we date, mate, break and remake our love lives.",sex,loveology

 Sue Black confronts death every day. As a Professor of Anatomy and Forensic Anthropology, she focuses on mortal remains in her lab, at burial sites, at scenes of violence, murder and criminal dismemberment, and when investigating mass fatalities due to war, accident or natural disaster. 
 
In <i>All That Remains</i> she reveals the many faces of death she has come to know, using key cases to explore how forensic science has developed, and examining what her life and work has taught her.
 
 Do we expect a book about death to be sad? Macabre? Sue's book is neither. There is tragedy, but there is also humour in stories as gripping as the best crime novel.
 
 Part memoir, part science, part meditation on death, her book is compassionate, surprisingly funny, and it will make you think about death in a new light.

221,Paying the Land,"<b>In his first full-length work of journalism in a decade, the 'heir to R. Crumb and Art Spiegelman' (<i>Economist</i>) brings his comics mastery to a story of indigenous North America, resource extraction, and our debt to the natural world</b>
<b>
</b><b>*A <i>GUARDIAN </i>BOOK OF THE YEAR*
</b> 
The Dene have lived in the vast Mackenzie River Valley since time immemorial, by their account. To the Dene, the land owns them, not the other way around-it is central to their livelihood and their very way of being. But the subarctic Canadian Northwest Territories are also home to valuable natural resources, including oil, gas and diamonds.

But the subarctic Canadian Northwest Territories are also home to valuable natural resources, including oil, gas and diamonds.

The election of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as successor to Pope John Paul II aroused tremendous interest not only among Catholics but throughout the world. Formerly the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith and known for his stand against liberation theology and social activism on issues such as homosexuality,  in his first days as Pope demonstrated a pastoral and very human face to the world.

Robert Moynihan sets the scene for his momentous election and then surveys his writings: on Jesus, Mary and the Sacrements, on the wider issues of faith and spirituality, and on the world today.

234,The Popularity Illusion,"<b>Who doesn't want to be more popular? Popularity expert Professor Mitch Prinstein shows that perhaps we should be careful what we wish for ...
</b>
Surely a person's popularity, be it at school, work or on social media, is the best predictor of how happy and successful they will be? The truth is actually much more complex and is based on millennia of human evolution. In this impeccably researched and highly entertaining book, Professor Mitch Prinstein reveals that there are two very distinct types of popularity: the first based on status and the second based on likeability. Whilst we may be hardwired to crave status, only one of these types will really get you where you want. 

Based on two decades of research into the human psyche and genetic make-up, <i>The Popularity Illusion </i>reveals the  science behind what popularity is and why we care about it so much – even if we don't think we do. Investigating  social media phenomena, playground cliques and work place politics, Professor Mitch Prinstein explores how popularity taps into our basic need to survive and examines the surprising links to our health and lifespan, offering important insights for all of us about how we can cultivate the right kind of popularity of ourselves and our children.
 
 An enlightening read on a topic that has fascinated us for centuries, <i>The Popularity Illusion</i> will show you how popularity influences your life in unexpected ways.

The Duprets, upper-class owners of a Birmingham iron-foundry, struggle to keep the business going in the 1920s, while young Lily Gates keeps house for three men who are employed there: the patriarchal Craigan, who owns the house; her worthless father Joe; and stalwart Jim, who is bashfully courting her. Sensing, however, that life must hold greater excitement than she can hope for in this closed little world, Lily succumbs to the bolder approach of a rival suitor, Bert, who takes her to the pictures and, eventually, to Liverpool with a view to a new life in Canada. Bert is not destined to stay the course, though, and the affair ends in tears. Bravely Lily returns to her threadbare household.

The Duprets, upper-class owners of a Birmingham iron-foundry, struggle to keep the business going in the 1920s, while young Lily Gates keeps house for three men who are employed there: the patriarchal Craigan, who owns the house; her worthless father Joe; and stalwart Jim, who is bashfully courting her. Sensing, however, that life must hold greater excitement than she can hope for in this closed little world, Lily succumbs to the bolder approach of a rival suitor, Bert, who takes her to the pictures and, eventually, to Liverpool with a view to a new life in Canada. Bert is not destined to stay the course, though, and the affair ends in tears. Bravely Lily returns to her threadbare household.

245,"They Fight Like Soldiers, They Die Like Children","In conflicts around the world, there is an increasingly popular weapon system that needs negligible technology, is simple to sustain, has unlimited versatility, and an incredible capacity for both loyalty and barbarism.  What are these cheap, renewable, plentiful, sophisticated, and expendable weapons?  Children.

This important book is part of a passionate personal mission against the use of child soldiers, by the three-star general who commanded the UN mission in Rwanda.

When Romeo Dallaire was tasked with achieving peace there in 1994, he and his force found themselves caught up in a vortex of civil war and genocide. He left Rwanda a broken man, disillusioned, suicidal, a story he told in the award-winning international sensation <i>Shake Hands with the Devil</i>. 

Now, in <i>They Fight Like Soldiers, They Die Like Children</i>, Dallaire provides an emotionally daring and intellectually enlightening introduction to the child soldier phenomenon, as well as concrete solutions for its total eradication.

Dallaire speaks up for those without a voice - children in conflicts around the globe who do not choose to fight, but who through ill-fate and the accident of birth find their way into soldiering.

<b><i>THE TIMES</i>' THRILLER OF THE MONTH </b>

'A <b>heart-pounding </b>survival thriller set in the starkly beautiful far north of Norway. <b>Gripping and adrenalin-fuelled</b>, yet also written with a tenderness that warms even the most chilling of chases.' LUCY CLARKE, author of <i>The Castaways</i>

Erik Amdahl and his spirited daughter, Sofia, have embarked on a long-promised cross-country ski trip deep into Norway's arctic circle. For Erik, it's the chance to bond properly with his remaining daughter following a tragic accident. For Sofia, it's the proof she needs that her father does care.

Then, far from home in this snowbound wilderness, with night falling and the mercury plummeting, an accident sends them in search of help - and shelter. Nearby is the home of a couple - members of Norway's indigenous Sami people - who they've met before, and who welcome them in. Erik is relieved.
He believes the worst is over. He thinks that Sofia is now safe. He could not be more wrong.
Because he and Sofia are not the old couple's only visitors that night - and soon he and his daughter will be running for their lives . . .

And beneath the swirling light show of the Northern Lights, a desperate fight ensues - of man against man, of man against nature - a fight for survival that plays out across the snow and ice.

A story of endurance and of the desperate, instinctive will to survive, of a father's love for his child, of knowing when to let go - and of a daughter's determination to prove herself worthy of that love, <i>Where Blood Runs Cold </i>is a pulse-racing thriller from a master storyteller.

248,My Name Is Selma,"Selma van de Perre was seventeen when the Second World War began. Until then, being Jewish in the Netherlands had been of no consequence. But by 1941 it was a matter of life or death. Several times, Selma avoided being rounded up by the Nazis. Then, in an act of defiance, she joined the Resistance movement, using the pseudonym Margareta van der Kuit. For two years 'Marga' risked it all. Using a fake ID, and passing as Aryan she travelled the country delivering newsletters, sharing information, keeping up morale  - doing, as she later said, what 'had to be done'. In July 1944 her luck ran out. She was transported to Ravensbrück women's concentration camp as a political prisoner. Unlike her parents and sister - who, she later discovered, died in other camps - she survived by using her alias. It was only after the war ended that she was allowed to reclaim her identity and dared to say once again: My name is Selma. Now, at ninety-nine, Selma remains a force of nature.

But by 1941 it was a matter of life or death. Several times, Selma avoided being rounded up by the Nazis. Then, in an act of defiance, she joined the Resistance movement, using the pseudonym Margareta van der Kuit. For two years 'Marga' risked it all. Using a fake ID, and passing as Aryan she travelled the country delivering newsletters, sharing information, keeping up morale  - doing, as she later said, what 'had to be done'. In July 1944 her luck ran out. She was transported to Ravensbrück women's concentration camp as a political prisoner. Unlike her parents and sister - who, she later discovered, died in other camps - she survived by using her alias.

287,Towards the Flame,"'As much as anything, World War I turned on the fate of Ukraine...'

The decision to go to war in 1914 had catastrophic consequences for Russia. The result was revolution, civil war and famine in 1917-20, followed by decades of Communist rule. Dominic Lieven's powerful and original new book, based on exhaustive and unprecedented study in Russian and many other foreign archives, explains why this suicidal decision was made and explores the world of the men who made it, thereby consigning their entire class to death or exile and making their country the victim of a uniquely terrible political experiment under Lenin and Stalin.

But Towards the Flame is about far more than Russia.

By looking at the origins and results of the First World War from a mostly Russian angle it offers a radically different view of why Europe descended into disaster. Dominic Lieven's interpretation of Europe's great war and Russia's revolution will overturn assumptions about events that still have major implications for world history down to the present day.",russia history,russian revolution book

291,The Road to Wanting,"<i>Sometimes the hardest journey is the road home.</i>

Na Ga was always in search of a better life. But now she sits, alone, in a hotel room in Wanting, a godforsaken town on the Chinese-Burmese border. Plucked from her wild life as a rural eel-catcher, Na Ga is then abandoned by her would-be rescuers in Rangoon. Later, as a teenager, she finds herself chasing the dream of a new life in Thailand - where further betrayals and violations await. Yet it seems that her fighting spirit will not be broken. 

But for how long can Na Ga belong nowhere and with no one? In the dingy hotel in Wanting she is forced to confront her compulsion to keep running, and to ask herself why, until now, she's resisted the journey home.

292,A World by Itself,"Scholarship on the history of the British Isles is currently experiencing a golden age. The breakdown of modernism and the eclipse of both the Marxist tradition and the 'Whig interpretation' that sees all history as progress, combined with the trajectories of nationalism in Ireland, Scotland and Wales, have generated unprecedented intellectual activity. 

Nor has the world stood still: the collapse of communism, the issue of integration into the EU, and the advance of multiculturalism have led more and more people in the English speaking world as a whole to sense that their collective landscape now looks profoundly different from that inhabited by their ancestors even a few decades ago.

In <i>A World By Itself</i>, six distinguished historians offer the most definitive and compelling history of the British Isles to date. Tracing the political, religious and material cultures from the Romans to the present day, this is at once an urgent reassessment of our shared past, and an inspirational celebration of British history. It focuses on the major themes and most dramatic moments of the last two millenia: the rise and fall of empires; reformation, revolution and restoration; wars both civil and global; and the enduring question of what it means to be British.",british history book,british history book

Simon Serrailler is awoken into a hazy dawn by the sharp ringing of his phone. Called out to the scene, he’s told that there’s a body strung up in tranquil Harnham Woods. But on closer inspection it’s an effigy – a carefully made dummy, stirring in the breeze. Simon knows that this is no practical joke. It’s a message.
 
The gruesome result of the search will show that he was right. And the trail will lead him into a dark history of deceit, subterfuge and the damaged lives of soldiers recently returned from Afghanistan. But the question remains: who has finally got their revenge?

303,The Long Tail,"What happens when there is almost unlimited choice? When everything becomes available to everyone? And when the combined value of the millions of items that only sell in small quantities equals or even exceeds the value of a handful of best-sellers?

In this ground-breaking book, Chris Anderson shows that the future of business does not lie in hits - the high-volume end of a traditional demand curve - but in what used to be regarded as misses - the endlessly long tail of that same curve. As our world is transformed by the Internet and the near infinite choice it offers consumers, so traditional business models are being overturned and new truths revealed about what consumers want and how they want to get it. 

Chris Anderson first explored the Long Tail in an article in <i>Wired</i> magazine that has become one of the most influential business essays of our time. Now, in this eagerly anticipated book, he takes a closer look at the new economics of the Internet age, showing where business is going and exploring the huge opportunities that exist: for new producers, new e-tailers, and new tastemakers. He demonstrates how long tail economics apply to industries ranging from the toy business to advertising to kitchen appliances. He sets down the rules for operating in a long tail economy. And he provides a glimpse of a future that's already here.",strickly business,inevitable

303,The Long Tail,"What happens when there is almost unlimited choice? When everything becomes available to everyone? And when the combined value of the millions of items that only sell in small quantities equals or even exceeds the value of a handful of best-sellers?

In this ground-breaking book, Chris Anderson shows that the future of business does not lie in hits - the high-volume end of a traditional demand curve - but in what used to be regarded as misses - the endlessly long tail of that same curve. As our world is transformed by the Internet and the near infinite choice it offers consumers, so traditional business models are being overturned and new truths revealed about what consumers want and how they want to get it. 

Chris Anderson first explored the Long Tail in an article in <i>Wired</i> magazine that has become one of the most influential business essays of our time. Now, in this eagerly anticipated book, he takes a closer look at the new economics of the Internet age, showing where business is going and exploring the huge opportunities that exist: for new producers, new e-tailers, and new tastemakers.

304,Hope Against Hope,"'Suddently, at about one o'clock in the morning, there was a sharp, unbearably explicit knock on the door. 'They've come for Osip', I said'.

In 1933 the poet Osip Mandelstam- friend to Boris Pasternak and Anna Akhmatova- wrote a spirited satire denouncing Josef Stalin. It proved to be a sixteen-line death sentence. For his one act of defiance he was arrested by the Cheka, the secret police, interrogated, exiled and eventually re-arrested. He died en route to one of Stalin's labour camps. 

His wife, Nadezhda (1899-1980) was with him on both occasions when he was arrested, and she loyally accompanied him into exile in the Urals, where he wrote his last great poems. Although his mind had been unbalanced by his ordeal in prison, his spirit remained unbroken. Eager to solve 'the Mandelstam problem', the Soviet authorities invited the couple to stay in a rest home near Moscow. Nadezhda saw it as an opportunity for her husband to mend his shattered life, but it was a trap and he was arrested for the last time.

'My case will never be closed', Osip once said, and it is mostly through the courageous efforts of Nadezhda that his memory has been preserved. <i>Hope against Hope</i>, her first volume of memoirs, is a vivid and disturbing account of her last four years with her husband, the efforts she made to secure his release, to rescue his manuscripts from oblivion, and later, tragically, to discover the truth about his mysterious death. It is also a harrowing, first-hand account of how Stalin and his henchmen persecuted Russia's literary intelligentsia in the 1930s and beyond.

Nadezhda Mandelstam spent most of the Second World War in Tashkent, living with her friend Akhmatova. Only in 1964 was she at last granted permission to return to Moscow. Here she began <i>Hope against Hope</i>, and later <i>Hope Abandoned</i>, the two memoirs of her life.",last hope,poetry diary 2022

311,The Life and Legend of the Sultan Saladin,"<b>'Superbly researched and enormously entertaining... One of the outstanding books of the year' <i>The Times</i></b>

<b>An epic story of empire-building and bloody conflict, this ground-breaking biography of one of history’s most venerated military and religious heroes opens a window on the Islamic and Christian worlds’ complex relationship.</b>
 
WINNER OF THE SLIGHTLY FOXED BEST FIRST BIOGRAPHY PRIZE

When Saladin recaptured Jerusalem from the Crusaders in 1187, returning the Holy City to Islamic rule, he sent shockwaves throughout Christian Europe and the Muslim Near East that reverberate today.

It was the culmination of a supremely exciting life. Born into a significant Kurdish family in northern Iraq, this warrior and diplomat fought under the banner of jihad, but at the same time worked tirelessly to build an empire that stretched from North Africa to Western Iraq. Gathering together a turbulent coalition, he was able to capture Jerusalem, only to trigger the Third Crusade and face his greatest adversary, King Richard the Lionheart.

Drawing on a rich blend of Arabic and European sources, this is a comprehensive account of both the man and the legend to which he gave birth, describing vividly the relentless action of his life and tracing its aftermath through culture and politics all the way to the present day.

Written with all of the depth, passion and deep human understanding that defines Orwell's writing this is incredible work of non-fiction tells of the battles that were faced by ordinary working people as they fought for both their lives and their ideologies. Although Orwell was himself near-fatally wounded he finds both bleak and comic notes in his experience which is recorded with such clarity and depth that this short work has become one of his best known.

Despite a mixture of laudatory and politically biased reviews, that first edition of 1,500 copies had still not sold out by the time Orwell died, twelve years after the book was published.",orwell essay,history book

When Carol Loomis first mentioned a little known Omaha hedge fund manager in a 1966 <i>Fortune </i>article, she didn't dream that Warren Buffett would one day be considered the world's greatest investor - nor that she and Buffett would quickly become close personal friends.

As Buffett's fortune and reputation grew, Loomis used her unique insight into Buffett's thinking to chronicle his work for <i>Fortune</i>, writing and proposing scores of stories that tracked his many accomplishments - and his occasional mistakes.

Now Loomis has collected and updated the best Buffett articles <i>Fortune </i>published between 1966 and 2012, including thirteen cover stories and a dozen pieces authored by Buffett himself. Readers will gain fresh insights into Buffett's investment strategies and his thinking on management, philanthropy, public policy, and even parenting.

Scores of Buffett books have been written, but none can claim this combination of trust between two friends, the writer's deep understanding of Buffett's world, and a long-term perspective.",fortune keeper,buffettology

But plenty of others saw, in the trucks that passed by without stopping, and from the roadside dhaba where he’d been drinking all night.</i>

326,Creation,"THE <B>ORIGIN</B> OF LIFE: <B>What is life? Where did it come from? In what form did it first appear? And how?</B>

Every creature, plant and cell that has ever inhabited the Earth owes its existence to the emergence, some four billion years ago, of a single life-form: the first ever living being, from which all other life subsequently evolved. Drawing on recent and dramatic advances in experimental biology, <I>The Origin of Life</I> takes us on a gripping, four-billion-year journey of discovery to explain exactly how such a thing could have happened.

<b>
<i>Cheer the F**K Up</i> </b>is a bold, brilliant and very personal account of a young comedian's experiences with mental health. An ode to the importance of friendship, Jack Rooke takes us on a mission to better understand the reasons why so many people are struggling, and how we can all feel better equipped in knowing how to support that one friend we might be that bit more worried about.

Part comedic memoir, part advice guide, this book is a fresh and timely take on a huge issue very close to Jack's heart - in 2015, while working as an ambassador for a male mental health charity,  he lost one of his best friends to suicide.

Taking you on a journey through his life and experiences with grief, sexuality, depression and more, Jack offers his own frank and powerful advice on how best to have meaningful conversations about a loved one's state of mind. Hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure, <i>Cheer the F**K Up</i> will definitely make you laugh and might just make you cry, but it could also help save a life.",mental health book,cry help

An ode to the importance of friendship, Jack Rooke takes us on a mission to better understand the reasons why so many people are struggling, and how we can all feel better equipped in knowing how to support that one friend we might be that bit more worried about.

Part comedic memoir, part advice guide, this book is a fresh and timely take on a huge issue very close to Jack's heart - in 2015, while working as an ambassador for a male mental health charity,  he lost one of his best friends to suicide.

Taking you on a journey through his life and experiences with grief, sexuality, depression and more, Jack offers his own frank and powerful advice on how best to have meaningful conversations about a loved one's state of mind. Hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure, <i>Cheer the F**K Up</i> will definitely make you laugh and might just make you cry, but it could also help save a life.",jack stainton book,sad book

<b>Dennis Nilsen, who died in May 2018, admitted to killing at least 15 people before his arrest in 1983. This ground-breaking criminal study of his killings was written with Nilsen's full cooperation, resulting in a fascinating - and horrifying - portrait of the man who worshipped death.</b><b>
</b>
In February 1983, residents of Muswell Hill had been plagued by blocked drains. When a plumber was called to investigate, he discovered a large blockage of biological material. To his horror, it appeared to be formed of human flesh and bones.

The next day, local resident Dennis Nilsen was arrested.

<b>'Are we talking about one body or two?' a detective asked. Nilsen replied 'Fifteen or sixteen, since 1978. I'll tell you everything.' 
</b>
Within days he had confessed to fifteen gruesome murders over a period of four years. His victims, mostly young gay men at a time when society cared little for them, had been overlooked. <i>Killing for Company </i>is a unique study of a murderer's mind, essential reading for true crime aficionados.

In a small town in balmy Provence, a dazzling encounter with Love itself changes the life of orphan Marie-Jeanne forever.

As a girl, Marie-Jeanne realizes that she can see the marks Love has left on the people around her - tiny glowing lights on their faces and hands that shimmer more brightly when the one meant for them is near. Before long, Marie-Jeanne is playing matchmaker in her village.

As she grows up, Marie-Jeanne helps her foster father, Francis, set up a mobile library that travels through the many small mountain towns in the region of Nyons. Their library will offer entertainment, guidance, reassurance and comfort - balm for the heartbroken and lonely. Marie-Jeanne soon finds herself bringing soulmates together everywhere they go, with books always playing an essential part in her quest.
However, the only person that Marie-Jeanne can't seem to find a partner for is herself. She has no glow of her own, though she waits and waits for it to appear. Everyone must have a soulmate, surely - but will Marie-Jeanne be able to recognize hers when Love finally comes her way?

As she grows up, Marie-Jeanne helps her foster father, Francis, set up a mobile library that travels through the many small mountain towns in the region of Nyons. Their library will offer entertainment, guidance, reassurance and comfort - balm for the heartbroken and lonely. Marie-Jeanne soon finds herself bringing soulmates together everywhere they go, with books always playing an essential part in her quest.
However, the only person that Marie-Jeanne can't seem to find a partner for is herself. She has no glow of her own, though she waits and waits for it to appear. Everyone must have a soulmate, surely - but will Marie-Jeanne be able to recognize hers when Love finally comes her way?

345,Spartacus: The Gladiator,"<b>The first of two epic novels which tell the story of one of the most  charismatic heroes history has ever known - Spartacus, the gladiator  slave who took on and nearly defeated the might of Rome, during the  years 73-71 BC.</b>

Historically very little is known about  Spartacus.  We know that he came from Thrace, a land north of Greece,  that he once fought in the Roman legions and that, during two fateful  years, he led a slave army which nearly brought Rome to its knees.

In  Ben Kane's brilliant novel, we meet Spartacus as he returns to Thrace,  ready to settle down after a decade away.  But a new king has usurped  the throne.  Treacherous and violent, he immediately seizes Spartacus  and sells him to a Roman slave trader looking for new gladiators.

The  odyssey has begun which will see Spartacus become one of the greatest  legends of history, the hero of revolutionaries from Karl Marx to Che  Guevara, immortalised on screen, and now brought to life in Ben Kane's  great bestseller - a novel which takes the story to its halfway point  and is continued in <i>Spartacus:  Rebellion.

The meditations include a searching exploration of the state of the soul and a lament on the loss of purity, and the Proslogion discusses the mysteries of faith.

Dear Respected Online Customer

Welcome to the page of the first ever official Rudge Park yearbook. And thank you very much in advance for purchasing the book at the incredibly reasonable price they are bound to be selling it at.

When I put myself forward to be the editor of the yearbook, my Head of Sixth Form Mr Gilbert was the first to wish me words of wisdom and support. His actual words - 'Well, McKenzie, I'm looking forward to seeing how you piss this one up' - were the inspiration behind this book. Sadly, and this is not an apology, due to a print schedule that can only be described as fascistic, I wasn't able to finish the book to my exact liking. However, I was very lucky that my 'friends', Jay Cartwright, Simon Cooper and Neil Sutherland decided to supply a lot of the material

So, inside this 'masterpiece' (Polly McKenzie) you'll find: Simon's Love Poetry, Jay's A-Z of Sex and (nonsensical) Business Plan, the Camber Sands Caravan Club newsletter, Neil's Biology coursework, entitled Do You Put the Balls In? and his map of Rudge Park, along with some incisive pieces of journalism, most likely written by me. And there's lots of other random stuff which has never seen the light of day. God knows how it got in there.

It is my greatest, and only, achievement from my two years at Rudge Park. May it bring you years of happiness and joy, and not just on the toilet.

366,All The King's Men,"""The British soldier,"" wrote a Prussian officer who served with Wellington, ""is vigorous, well fed, by nature highly brave and intrepid, trained to the most vigorous discipline, and admirably well armed... These circumstances explain how this army ... has never yet been defeated in the field.""

From the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 to the Downfall of Napoleon in 1815, Britain won a series of major wars against France that enabled her to lay the foundations of a global empire. By Waterloo, she was the paramount maritime and industrial power in the world, and would remain so for much of the nineteenth century.

370,Know My Name,"She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford's campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on Buzzfeed, where it instantly went viral - viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time. 

Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways - there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life. 

<i>Know My Name</i> will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world.

But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life. 

<i>Know My Name</i> will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world. Entwining pain, resilience, and humour, this memoir will stand as a modern classic.",pete turner,emily

373,Nothing Ever Just Disappears,"At the turn of the century, in the shade of Cambridge's cloisters, a young E. M. Forster conceals his passion for other men, even as he daydreams about the sun-warmed bodies of ancient Greece. Under the dazzling lights of interwar Paris, Josephine Baker dances her way to fame and fortune and discovers sexual freedom backstage at the Folies Bergère. And on Jersey, in the darkest days of Nazi occupation, the transgressive surrealist Claude Cahun mounts an extraordinary resistance to save the island she loves, scattering hundreds of dissident artworks along its streets and shorelines.

381,"Conquests, Catastrophe and Recovery","<b>Beginning with the Norman Conquest of England, these tumultuous centuries and their invasions shaped the languages and political geography of present-day Britain and Ireland.</b>
<b></b> 
The Irish, Scots and Welsh fought their battles against the English with varying success - struggles which, like the events of 1066 in England, produced spectacular upheavals and left enduring national memories. But there was still a common enemy: the Black Death - still the greatest catastrophe in their history.

There were significant advances, too. Hundreds of new towns were founded; slavery, still prevalent until the twelfth century, died out; magnificent cathedrals built, schools and universities established; clocks, gunpowder and the printing press. Magna Carta set new standards for holding governments to account and trial by jury won a central place in the legal systems of England and Scotland. 

Tracing the political, religious and material cultures of the period, as well as what might have been, John Gillingham seeks to define the ways in which lives changed during these turbulent times. With the words of contemporaries to guide us, we can understand more than ever before about national identities and the differences which came to define and ultimately untie these islands.",england,british history book

383,The Road To Somewhere,"Celebrating the wonder, comedy and adventure to be found in the most unlikely places, best-selling author James Dodson takes his young son Jack on a once-in-lifetime trip through the great cities and eccentric byways of Europe. 

There are two kinds of travel, someone once said: first class and with children. During the summer of 2001, Jim Dodson discovers that travelling with a kid can almost make a grown man feel - and behave - like a child again. Two battered bags and an old baseball glove in hand, father and son set out to circle the globe and spy the wonders of the world. But the best-laid plans usually tend to go awry and Jim and Jack encounter a myriad of unforeseen obstacles during their journey - some hilarious and others heartbreaking. What they discover, on the busy marketplaces and sightseeing hot spots, the country inns and dusty back roads of Western Europe, are not the knights and dragons young Jack had once dreamed of, but something far more valuable: each other's company and a world where, at the end of the day, unexpected laughter and pain can make us all friendly small-town neighbours. With humour, warmth and wisdom, James Dodson explores the meaning of father-son relationships and the importance of finding and savouring friendship, beauty and wonder - especially when you least expect them.",jamie £1 wonder,wonder book

396,Find Spot at the Hospital,"<b>It's Spot's first time going to hospital, as he visits his poorly friend Tom. What will it be like?</b>

In this new lift-the-flap story, Spot and Mum head to the hospital to see his friend Tom, who has hurt his leg. But on their way to the Children's Ward, Spot disappears! Where did he go? 

Toddlers will enjoy joining Spot as he is introduced to the different areas of a hospital for the first time - as well as the doctors and nurses that they he meets on his visit.

An added early learning spread at the end of the book also teaches children key hospital-themed vocabulary from the story.

With interactive flaps to train fine motor skills, and an adventure that sparks curiosity and imagination, <i>Find Spot at the Hospital </i>is perfect for early learning and play. 

<b>Eric Hill's <i>Where's Spot?</i> was the first ever lift-the-flap book - and his ground-breaking innovation continues to delight and surprise readers with interactive fun. Spot has now been a trusted character in early learning for over 40 years, selling over 65 million books worldwide.</b>

396,Find Spot at the Hospital,"<b>It's Spot's first time going to hospital, as he visits his poorly friend Tom. What will it be like?</b>

In this new lift-the-flap story, Spot and Mum head to the hospital to see his friend Tom, who has hurt his leg. But on their way to the Children's Ward, Spot disappears! Where did he go? 

Toddlers will enjoy joining Spot as he is introduced to the different areas of a hospital for the first time - as well as the doctors and nurses that they he meets on his visit.

An added early learning spread at the end of the book also teaches children key hospital-themed vocabulary from the story.

With interactive flaps to train fine motor skills, and an adventure that sparks curiosity and imagination, <i>Find Spot at the Hospital </i>is perfect for early learning and play. 

<b>Eric Hill's <i>Where's Spot?</i> was the first ever lift-the-flap book - and his ground-breaking innovation continues to delight and surprise readers with interactive fun. Spot has now been a trusted character in early learning for over 40 years, selling over 65 million books worldwide.</b>

397,They Made Great Britain,"From the end of the last Ice Age (10,000 years ago) to the death of Winston Churchill in 1965, Adrian Sykes narrates the history and achievements of these islands,their inhabitants and their origins,through the stories of some 3000+ men &amp; women who have shaped not just our history but the modern world.

What began as an attack on the West by Osama bin Laden soon became a dramatic confrontation between Europe and America.

401,Jungle Tales,"Years of tradition crashed around the ears of Celtic supporters when the Jungle was demolished and replaced by seating to conform with the Taylor Report.

To them it was the nerve-centre of all that was good about their team and about Scottish football in general. There they had gathered to witness the great dramas unfold, the star players weave their artistry, and there they experienced the nerve-jangling, magical nights as Celtic joined the ranks of great European sides in the 1960s.

Star players past and present describe their favourite memories and the fans themselves recall the scenes indelibly etched in their minds. <i>Jungle Tales</i> is an exercise in pure nostalgia.

405,The Elizabethan World Picture,"The Elizabethans took from the Middle Ages the modified view of the universe which, Platonic and biblical in origin, radically differed from our own. For them all creation was ranged in an unalterable order from the angels down to man - for whom the world existed - and thence to the beasts and plants. In this short study Dr Tillyard not only elucidates such fairly familiar - though often mystifying - concepts as the four elements, the celestial harmony of 'nine enfolded Sphears', or macrocosm and microcosm; he also shows how this world picture was variously regarded as a chain of being, a network of correspondences, and a cosmic dance. Such concepts were commonplace to the Elizabethans. By expounding them the author has rendered plain, and not merely picturesque, the literature and thinking of an age.",dc universe origin,elizabethan

411,Dark Shadows Falling,"In 1992, an Indian climber was left to die on the South Col of Mount Everest by other climbers who watched his feebly waving hand from their tent. He was filmed in his last hours for a television feature. Why did onlookers not hold the dying man's hand and comfort him? The answer appals Joe Simpson, who was himself left for dead in a cervasse in Peru in 1985 - 'because it might compromise their summit bid'. It is an ethical question that Joe is forced to confront as he climbs a hazardous route on Pumori. 

Now that Everest has become the playground of the rich, where commercial operators offer guided tours to the top, camping admist the detritus and unburied corpses of previous less fortunate climbers, Joe wonders if the noble instincts that once characterised mountaineering have been irrevocably displaced - as in politics, in business, in the media and in other facets of society.",tower climber 3,climber

412,Since I Was a Princess,"In <i>Once I Was a Princess</i>, Jacqueline Pascarl related the gripping story of her abusive childhood and her subsequent teen marriage to a prince. What should have been a fairy tale with a happy ending deteriorated into a nightmare of deceit and betrayal - ending in the kidnapping of her two small children by her former husband, who spirited them back to Malaysia.

In <i>Since I Was a Princess</i>, Pascarl peels back the layers of her life after the abduction. She tells how she channelled her grief, forging an existence as an aid worker and humanitarian ambassador in war-torn countries and working with refugees and the dispossessed. She describes how she persuaded some of the world's most influential figures to support her aid work and became a human rights activist on the international stage, championing the cause of other parents whose children had been kidnapped and reuniting scores of families.

Pascarl also explains how she lived frenetically as she painfully rebuilt her life and re-evaluated her relationships, grappling with the emotional complexities of a new pregnancy and beginning a second family. And she reveals for the first time the dramatic details of how, at last, she was able to be reunited with her long-lost children and make her family whole.

Yet they disagree about the best path forward: do they look to the ancient past - to long-lost language and culture - or to the ideology and technology of the present. . . 
  
<i>The Archeologist</i>, Andreas Karkavitsas' masterpiece, is at once a powerful allegory for the questions facing Greek nationalism at the turn of the century, as well as a vision of Europe that, conceived on the precipice of the First World War, now resounds with tragedy.
  
Also included in this edition are a selection of 'sea tales' - folk stories told to Karakvitas by sailors, fishermen and sponge-divers during his travels in the Mediterranean. Staples of Greek literature, these four sea stories are considered some of Karakvitsas' greatest achievements.",sea idiot,historical fiction

Or had your next thought fly out of your brain in the middle of a presentation? Or accidentally liked an old photo on someone's Instagram or Facebook, thus revealing yourself to be a creepy social media stalker?
 
 Melissa Dahl, <i>New York </i>magazine's ""Science of Us"" editor, has experienced all of those awkward situations, and many more. Now she offers a thoughtful, original take on what it really means to feel awkward. She invites you to follow her into all sorts of mortifying moments, drawing on personal experience and in-depth psychological research to answer questions you've probably pondered at some point, such as:
 
 <b>*</b> Why are situations without clear rules most likely to turn awkward?
 
 <b>*</b> Are people really judging us as harshly as we think they are?
 
 <b>*</b> Does anyone ever truly outgrow their awkward teenage self?

Guy Martin, international road-racing legend, maverick star of the Isle of Man TT, truck mechanic and TV presenter, lives on the edge, addicted to speed, thoroughly exhilarated by danger. 
 
In this book we’ll get inside his head as he stares death in the face, and risks his life in search of the next high.

We’ll discover what it feels like to survive a 170mph fireball at the TT in 2010, and come back to do it all again. He’ll sweep us up in a gritty sort of glory as he slogs it out for a place on the podium, but we’ll also see him struggle with the flipside of fame.

Her storied career came to chronicle a living, breathing history of the struggles that defined the USA in the latter half of the twentieth century; and her poetry, accordingly, put its dazzling stylistic range to use in exploring issues of gender, race, immigration, representation and much else besides.

Here are poems of suffusing light and profound anger: poems moved as much by political animus as by a deep love for the observation of human life in all its foibles, eccentricities, strengths and weaknesses.

Pre-war reminiscences give an insight into a never-to-be-forgotten era, when London's nightclubs were the haunts of the aristocracy and of royalty, and the Prince of Wales would jump at any opportunity to play drums with the resident band. The elegant world of top hat, white ties and tails has gone for ever, but in Talking Swing the musicians relive those nights when they played for as long as the customers wanted to dance - often into the early hours of the morning. Out of London, there were the variety tours, where the band was top of the bill and there wasn't an empty seat in the house.

The problems faced by British musicians during the war years, when London's society bands continued to play throughout the Blitz, were enormous, and they are vividly portrayed in <i>Talking Swing</i>.

Amongst those recalled are Ambrose, Jack Hylton, Geraldo, Ted Heath and Syd Lawrence, who took over when almost everyone else had packed it in and who kept on swinging against all odds.

432,Everyday Trauma,"<b>Difficult experiences are unavoidable; transform your resilience in three simple steps.</b>

Contrary to long-held belief, trauma is not only caused by exposure to a single, extreme event. The cumulative effect of common stressors that we encounter in our day-to-day lives can have an equally significant impact on our mental and physical well-being. From difficult childhoods, to bereavements, pregnancy and childbirth, and even stressful jobs, traumas - both large and small - are a part of life we can't control, but we can change the way we respond to them.

In <i>Everyday Trauma</i>, distinguished neuroscientist Dr Tracey Shors draws on over thirty years of research to explain how your mind and body responds to trauma and how you can take control. Her science-based, three-step method is designed to help you process any kind of personal trauma from your past, reverse your symptoms and strengthen your resilience for stressors in your future. Its beauty is in its simplicity; by practicing her three simple mental and physical steps in combination twice a week, research has shown you can reduce the ruminative thoughts that trauma so often leaves us with, and avoid the trap of ongoing mental struggles such as anxiety, depression, insomnia and PTSD.

Whether you can access formal therapy or not, in this important book Dr Tracey Shors has provided the tools for you to help yourself through traumas in your past, present and future. No matter what life throws at you, you <i>can</i> take positive steps to heal your mind for a better life.

438,Red Rebels,"In 2004, Manchester United could proclaim itself the richest football club in the world, and boasted global commercial appeal alongside more than a decade of success on the pitch. In early 2005, American businessman Malcolm Glazer targeted a leveraged takeover of the club, and it looked set to be plunged into record levels of debt. The fans were furious. If the deal went wrong, it would threaten United's very existence, whilst the Glazers would be able to walk away without it having cost them a cent. Protests in the stands fell on deaf ears – it became increasingly clear that marches and placards wouldn’t make any difference to the Glazer family.

In May 2005 the takeover went ahead. In response, one group of supporters took a drastic step: rather than meekly fall into line and – through rocketing ticket prices – help fund the Glazers' aims of cashing in on Manchester United's history and traditions, they took the plunge and formed a new club that started life in the tenth tier of English football. The decision tore Manchester United's fan base apart, and caused ructions that continue to this day.

This is the story of FC United of Manchester, the phenomenon born out of a supporter revolution. Established against all odds, its constitution enabled supporters to each own part of the club and have a direct say in how it was run. It also adopted a transparent manifesto and ensured it could never be sold on for profit.

However, as generations that have gone before will testify, modern football is now as much a business as it is a sport. How long can a club set up in opposition to a culture of greed stay true to its principles? And in a noble attempt to do so, could it ultimately tear itself apart?",manchester metrolink,manchester

</b><b>Impassioned, witty and polemical, <i>At Your Own Risk </i>is Derek Jarman's defiant celebration of gay sexuality.</b>

In <i>At Your Own Risk</i>, Derek Jarman weaves poetry, prose, photographs and newspaper extracts into a rich tapestry of gay experience in the UK. The buttoned-up repression of the fifties and sixties makes way for liberation and free love in the seventies, only to be chased by the terror and pain of HIV/AIDS. This is Jarman at his passionate best, written when he was already ill with HIV and in the midst of the moral panic surrounding the AIDS crisis. Defiant and furious, he not only celebrates his own sexuality but skewers wider society for its brazen homophobia. 

Reissued here 25 years after Jarman's death, with an introduction by <i>Straight Jacket </i>author Matthew Todd, <i>At Your Own Risk</i> remains a singular work. It is a powerful reminder of how far we have come and how much further we have left to go.

<b>Meet the Flying Fortresses of the American Eighth Air Force, Britain’s Lancaster comrades, who helped to bring down the Nazis</b>

Historian and World War II expert Donald Miller brings us the story of the bomber boys who brought the war to Hitler's doorstep. Unlike ground soldiers they slept on clean beds, drank beer in local pubs, and danced to the swing music of the travelling Air Force bands. But they were also an elite group of fighters who put their lives on the line in the most dangerous role of all.

Miller takes readers from the adrenaline filled battles in the sky, to the airbases across England, the German prison camps, and onto the ground to understand the devastation faced by civilians.

448,The Awakened Brain,"<i>'We can live chasing goals and rewards, lost in worries and regrets. Or we can awaken to the true fabric of the world, an evolving tapestry that we both behold and help to create, in which every thread matters and no strand stands alone'</i>
<i>
</i>Lisa Miller has spent decades researching the effects of spirituality on the brain. In this book she draws on her clinical experience and award-winning research to show how an active spiritual life can transform our physical and psychological wellbeing. Bringing scientific rigour to the most intangible aspect of our lives, Miller offers insights into the neurological basis for the increased resilience that comes with nurturing spirituality and highlights its measurable positive effects: decreasing the likelihood of depression and substance abuse, and shifting the course of recovery in many other clinical settings.

 Woven throughout is Miller's personal story of how, while confronting her own challenges, her professional pragmatism gave way to a greater appreciation of insights that are important to so many people and yet so often dismissed as unscientific. Brimming with inspiration and compassion, this landmark book will revolutionize your understanding of spirituality, mental health and how we find meaning and purpose in life.",spirituality book,life

449,Wake,"Women warriors planned and led slave revolts on slave ships during the passage across the Atlantic. They fought their enslavers throughout the Americas. And then they were erased from history.

In <i>Wake</i> Rebecca Hall, a historian, a granddaughter of slaves, and a woman haunted by the legacy of slavery, tells their story. With in-depth archival research and a measured use of historical imagination, she constructs the likely pasts of women rebels who fought for freedom on slave ships bound to America, as well as the stories of women who led slave revolts in Colonial New York. Beneath both is Hall's own tale: of a life lived in the shadow of slavery and its consequences.
Strikingly illustrated in black and white, <i>Wake</i> explores both a personal and a global legacy. Part graphic novel, part memoir, it is a powerful reminder that while the past is gone, we still live in its wake.

454,The Imaginary Girlfriend,"From a novelist known for the complexity of his novels - they are also long - comes an autobiography of compelling simplicity; it is also short. Dedicated to the memory of two wrestling coaches and two writer friends, The Imaginary Girlfriend is a lucid portrait of the writers and wrestlers who played a mentor role in John Irving's development as a novelist, a wrestler and a wrestling coach. Moreover, this candid memoir portrays a father's dedication to his children: Irving coached his sons Colin and Brendan to New England championship titles - a championship that, as a competitor, he himself was denied.

John Irving began writing and wrestling when he was fourteen. He competed as a wrestler for twenty years, he was certified as a referee for twenty-four and he coached the sport until he was forty-seven. His thirty-three years in wrestling are three times those he spent as a student and a teacher of Creative Writing; yet his concise autobiography details the interrelationship of the disciplines of writing and wrestling - from the days when Irving was a beginner at both pursuits until his fourth wrestling-related surgery at the age of fifty-three.

462,Living with the Gods,"No society on Earth lacks beliefs about where it has come from, its place in the world, and the connection of individuals to the eternal. Until recently, it was widely assumed that religion was on the wane almost everywhere: now, far from becoming marginalised, the relationship between faith and society has moved to the centre of politics and global conversation. Neil MacGregor's new book traces how different societies have understood and articulated their place in the cosmic scheme. He examines mankind's beliefs not from the perspective of institutional religions, but by focusing on the shared narratives that have shaped societies - and on what happens when different narratives run up against each other. MacGregor brilliantly turns his kaleidoscope of objects, places and ideas to set these pressing contemporary concerns in the long perspectives of time and place.",skeleton society,society

<b>
</b><b>From the bestselling author of <i>The Long Weekend</i>: a wild, sad and sometimes hilarious tour of the English country house after the Second World War, when Swinging London collided with aristocratic values.</b>

As the sun set slowly on the British Empire in the years after the Second World War, the nation's stately homes were in crisis. Tottering under the weight of rising taxes and a growing sense that they had no place in twentieth-century Britain, hundreds of ancestral piles were dismantled and demolished. Perhaps even more surprising was the fact that so many of these great houses survived, as dukes and duchesses clung desperately to their ancestral seats and tenants' balls gave way to rock concerts, safari parks and day trippers.

From the Rolling Stones rocking Longleat to Christine Keeler rocking Cliveden, Noble Ambitions takes us on a lively tour of these crumbling halls of power, as a rakish, raffish, aristocratic Swinging London collided with traditional rural values. Capturing the spirit of the age, Adrian Tinniswood proves that the country house is not only an iconic symbol, but a lens through which to understand the shifting fortunes of Britain in an era of monumental social change.

What emerged was a prophetic and ferociously funny masterpiece of ideology and murder in pre-revolutionary Russia–a novel that is rivaled only by <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> as Dostoevsky’s greatest.

476,The Dark Valley,"Piers Brendon's magisterial overview of the 1930s is the story of the dark, dishonest decade - child of one world war and parent of the next - that determined the course of the twentieth century. 

Dealing individually with each of the period's great powers - the USA, Germany, Italy, France, Britain, Japan, Spain and Russia - Brendon takes us through the ten years dominated by the Great Depression and political turmoil. When Broadway, Piccadilly Circus, the Kurfurstendamm and the Ginza - neon metaphors of hope after four years of carnage - grew dim as the giants of unemployment, hardship, strife and fear took their hold. From the concentration camps of Dachau and Kolyma, the Ukraine famine and the American Dust Bowl, to the Moscow metro, the Empire State Building and the Paris Exposition, <i>The Dark Valley </i>brings the 1930's back to life through meticulous scholarship. 

Brendon examines the great leaders - Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, Mao Tse-Tung, Haile Selassie and countless others - not with hindsight but in the context of their age; but also, through a vivid chronicling of contemporary experience, he gives us a sense of what it was to be living then.",1930,1940s childhood book

480,Underground Empire,"Deep beneath our feet, vast and sprawling, lies one of the most sophisticated empires the world has ever known. At first glance, it might not look like much - it is made up of fibre optic cables and obscure payment systems. But according to prominent political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman, the United States has turned the most vital pathways of the world economy into tools of domination over foreign businesses and countries, whether they are rivals or allies, allowing it to maintain global supremacy.

Drawing on original reporting and ground-breaking research, Farrell and Newman explain how this underground empire has allowed the United States to eavesdrop on other countries and isolate its enemies. Now, efforts by countries such as China and Russia to untether themselves from this coercive US-led system are turning the global economy into a battle zone. Today's headlines about trade wars, sanctions, and controls on technology exports are merely tremors hinting at far greater seismic shifts beneath the surface, as we sleepwalk into a dangerous new struggle for empire.

Essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how power is wielded today, <i>Underground Empire</i> weaves together tales of economic conflict, shadowy surveillance and covert infrastructure projects to explain how the world order has been brought to the brink of chaos - and how we might find a way back from the edge.",economy,deep

487,Flags Of Our Fathers,"In this remarkably powerful book, James Bradley takes as his starting point one of the most famous photographs of all time. In February 1945, American Marines plunged into the surf at Iwo Jima and into a hail of machine-gun and mortar fire from 22,000 Japanese. After climbing through a hellish landscape and on to the island's highest peak, six men were photographed raising the stars and stripes. One of those soldiers was the author's father, John Bradley. He never spoke to his family about the photograph or about the war, but after his death in 1994, they discovered closed boxes of letters and photos which James Bradley draws on to retrace the lives of his father and his five companions.

Following these men's paths to Iwo Jima, Bradley has written a classic story of the heroic battle for the Pacific's most crucial island - an island riddled with sixteen miles of tunnels and defended by Japanese soldiers determined to fight to the death. In the thirty-six days of fighting, almost fifty-thousand men lost their lives.

Above all a human - and personal - story, few books have captured so brilliantly or so movingly the complexity of war and its aftermath and the true meaning of heroism.",cathy bradley,war fiction book

And as adults, she argues, the complex task of loving another depends, initially, on self-love and self-esteem.

The inspiring story of a German-Jewish family named Frank which, like Anne Frank's family and 25,000 other Dutch and other 'stateless' Jews, 'dived under' in Nazi-occupied Holland in 1942 - but miraculously survived. Told by the grandson of the head of the family, this is the gripping odyssey of the other Frank family: from childhood in an assimilated German-Jewish family at Breitenheim, through the deceptively good life of Berlin in the 1920s, to the rise of Hitler and their flight to apparently safe Holland, the nightmarish ordeal of their thousand day long 'submersion' in a small apartment in The Hague, and the joy and pain of liberation and their final journey to America, the same route Anne Frank might have taken had she not been betrayed. Based on personal testaments, records and family interviews, the book describes their life behind closed curtains in constant fear of discovery. In 1945, after many adventures and appalling vicissitudes, they finally emerged to face the uncertainties of postwar Holland and the promise of the New World.",frank mansell,ww2 book

498,The Dinner Guest,"<b>LONGLISTED FOR THE 2018 MAN BOOKER INTERNATIONAL PRIZE</b>
<i><b>
</b></i><b><i>The Dinner Guest</i> is Gabriela Ybarra’s prizewinning literary debut: a singular autobiographical novel piecing together the kidnap and murder of her grandfather by terrorists, reflecting on the personal impact of private pain and public tragedy.</b>
<i><i>
</i>The story goes that in my family there’s an extra dinner guest at every meal. He’s invisible, but always there. He has a plate, glass, knife and fork. Every so often he appears, casts his shadow over the table, and erases one of those present. </i>
<i>
The first to vanish was my grandfather.</i>

In 1977, three terrorists broke into Gabriela Ybarra’s grandfather’s home, and pointed a gun at him in the shower. 

This was the last time his family saw him alive, and his kidnapping played out in the press, culminating in his murder.

 Ybarra first heard the story when she was eight, but it was only after her mother’s death, years later, that she felt the need to go deeper and discover more about her family’s past.

<i>The Dinner Guest</i> is a novel, with the feel of documentary non-fiction.  It connects two life-changing events – the very public death of Ybarra’s grandfather, and the more private pain as her mother dies from cancer and Gabriela cares for her. Devastating yet luminous, the book is an investigation, marking the arrival of a talented new voice in international fiction.",dinner guest,man booker prize
